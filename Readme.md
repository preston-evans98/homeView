# ViMacs #

Welcome to ViMacs, a text editor for Unix systems written in the safe subset of Rust! Why ViMacs? Because this editor combines the worst features of Vim and Emacs! 

ViMacs is an example project to learn Rust, and Unix terminal commands. It implements basic features such as search and minimal syntax highlighting. It doesn't support multi-line highlighting (either for comments or for strings), but is otherwise feature complete. ViMacs is based on the kilo editor (http://antirez.com/news/108), and owes its existence to the following tutorial https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html.
